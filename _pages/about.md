I am a senior undergrad majoring in Data Science (Math + Computer Science) at [Yuanpei College](https://yuanpei.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn). 
I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Liwei Wang](http://www.liweiwang-pku.com/) in [School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Sciences](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/). 
I am interested in making Machine Learning tools more powerful and interpretable in practice through theories, algorithms design, and better implementation, especially in scientific problems. 
<br/>
If you are interested in working together, please feel free to contact me!
