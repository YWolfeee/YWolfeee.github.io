I am a senior undergraduate (4<sup>th</sup> / 5 year) in [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn), majoring in Data Science (Math + Computer Science). I am fortunate to research in Professor [Liwei Wang](http://www.liweiwang-pku.com/)'s group. My research interest lies in many fields, including foundation model, theory in deep learning and reinforcement, out-of-distribution learning and AI + Science.
