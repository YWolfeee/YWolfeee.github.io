I am a senior ï¼ˆ4<sup>th </sup>/5) undergraduate in [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn), majoring in Data Science and Big Data Technology (Math + Computer Science), while learning many core courses in other professions. I am fortunate to research in Professor [Liwei Wang](http://www.liweiwang-pku.com/)'s group. My research interest lies in many fields, including foundation model, theory in machine learning and out-of-distribution learning.
