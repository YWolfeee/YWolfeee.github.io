I am a first-year CS Ph.D. at Stanford University, currently working with Professor [Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/). Before that, I received my B.S. in Math and Computer Science at Yuanpei College, Peking University, under the advice of Professor [Liwei Wang](http://www.liweiwang-pku.com/) and [Di He](https://dihe-pku.github.io/). 
<br/>
<br/>
I am interested in making machine learning tools more powerful in scientific problems through theories, algorithms design, and high performance computing. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me!

News
======
- (Oct. 2023) We release [LapJAX](https://github.com/YWolfeee/lapjax), a JAX based package designed for efficient second order operators (e.g., Laplacian) computation. We used it to significantly advance the solving of multibody Schrödinger equations by an order of magnitude. Give it a try!
- (Sept. 2023) Our chain-of-thought theory paper is accepted for an **oral presentation** at NeurIPS 2023. See you in New Orleans!
- (Feb. 2023) I am selected as a "top reviewer" for AISTAT 2023.
