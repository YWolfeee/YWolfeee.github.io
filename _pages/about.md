I am a senior undergrad in [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn), majoring in Data Science (Math + Computer Science). 
I am fortunate to research with Professor [Liwei Wang](http://www.liweiwang-pku.com/). 
My research interest lies in many fields, including language models, theory in DL and RL, as well as AI for Science.
<br/>
I am going to apply for CS Ph.D. this year. If you are interested in working together, please feel free to contact me!
