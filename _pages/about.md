I am a third-year Ph.D. student at [Stanford CS](https://www.cs.stanford.edu/), advised by Professor [James Zou](https://www.james-zou.com/) and [Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/). Before that, I received my B.S. in Math and Computer Science at Yuanpei College, [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), under the advice of Professor [Liwei Wang](http://www.liweiwang-pku.com/) and [Di He](https://dihe-pku.github.io/). 
I focus on advancing generative AI (both for transformer and diffusion) through post-training and inference-time algorithm design. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in my work oy my talk.

News
======
- (Dec. 2025) We release [DDRL](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/ddrl/), a data-regularized RL algorithm for diffusion! It has been successfully used in NVIDIA [Cosmos-Predict2.5](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/cosmos-predict2.5/), where I was responsible for RL. Check our [post](https://x.com/haotian_yeee/status/1997138677529825452?s=20)!
- (Dec. 2025) [Data Attribution for RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19281) was accepted by NeurIPS 2025 (<font color="#DC143C">Oral</font>). See you in San Diego!
- (Nov. 2025) We released NVIDIA [Cosmos-Predict2.5](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/cosmos-predict2.5/), the Cosmos World Foundation Models specialized for video generation. I am responsible for designing the RL algorithm and performing large-scale post-training (1K+ GPUs) for the release. The algorithm paper will be publicized soon.
